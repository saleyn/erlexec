=======

    Execute and control OS processes from Erlang/OTP.

    This project implements a C++ port program and Erlang application
    that gives light-weight Erlang processes fine-grain control over
    execution of OS processes.

    It makes possible for an Erlang process to start, stop an OS process,
    send POSIX signals, know process IDs of the started OS process, set up
    a monitor and/or link to it. This application provides better control
    over OS processes than built-in erlang:open_port/2 command with a
    {spawn, Command} option, and performs proper OS child process cleanup
    when the emulator exits. 

    See [http://saleyn.github.com/erlexec] for more information.

SUPPORTED OS's
==============
    Linux, Solaris, MacOS X

BUILDING
========
    Make sure you have rebar (http://github.com/basho/rebar) installed
    locally and the rebar script is in the path.

    If you are deploying the application on Linux and would like to
    take advantage of exec-port running tasks using effective user IDs
    different from the real user ID that started exec-port, then
    make sure that libcap-dev[el] library is installed.

        OS-specific libcap-dev installation instructions:

        Fedora, CentOS: "yum install libcap-devel"
        Ubuntu:         "apt-get install libcap-dev"

    $ git clone git@github.com:saleyn/erlexec.git
    $ make

DEPLOYING
=========
    Run "make tar".  This produces a tarball which you can deploy to your
    destination environment and untar the content.
